# BixPythonProject0

## Bioinformatics Python Project

This project was conducted after the completion of my Introduction to Bioinformatics using Python module during my MSc in Applied Bioinformatics course at Cranfield University, UK.

## Summary Report of the Project
The project was designed to test my ability to use the argparse module to manipulate some text files from the command terminal.
The summarise_picard_metrics.py script was designed to work on plain Python, not Jupyter notebook or anything else, hence the “.y”. This program takes as input input folder (containing multiple subfolders), analyses the text files in each subfolder by counting the number of files in each subfolder, makes summary text files and plots and then hands back the results to a user-defined output folder. For information on how to run this program, please see the user manual of this program attached to the repo. Also attached is the technical report on the project explaining the technical details of the python code. Example output files and plots are referenced in the report.
